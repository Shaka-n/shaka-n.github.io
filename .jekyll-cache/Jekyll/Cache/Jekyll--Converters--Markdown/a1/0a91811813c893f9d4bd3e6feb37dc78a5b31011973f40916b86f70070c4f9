I"ÿ<p>Iâ€™ve used dozens of note taking applications in my life. The unspoken question is: why? In the years before cloud storage note apps, MS Word was good enough for me. I had a folder called â€œDocuments,â€ which in itself contained more folders called banal things like â€œSchool,â€ or â€œReceipts,â€ or â€œRestricted Access, Do Not Open!!â€ Things were simpler, and I felt organized, clean, and in control of my extra-cerebral faculties. More on that later. Then one day, The Cloud rolled into town.</p>
