 My name is Stefan Sahagian, I'm a software developer, and this is my blog. I've been working in software development for the past 3 years, and here I talk about coding and the mindset I try to cultivate around it. I like working with Elixir, Ruby, and Javascript, but I'm always willing to pick up a new set of tools.

 When I'm not coding, you can probably find me cooking or playing with power tools.
