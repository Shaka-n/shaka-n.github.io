My name is Garen Stefan Sahagian, and I prefer to go by Stefan. I'm a former writer/editor turned programmer since graduating from the Flatiron School in 2020. Since then I've worked in a wide range of settings with a wide range of tools. From maintaing legacy solutions for banking clients in C#, to building new insure-tech tools from scratch in Elixir, to consulting on website rennovations for small businesse in Ruby. My varied experiences have instilled in me a tendency for divergent thinking, creativity, and far-reaching curiosity.

I'm looking for a job, by the way, so feel free to drop me a line if you have something in mind.
